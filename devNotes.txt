RECENT ADDITIONS

    -dialogBox is working, npc messages
    -Npc class is written, holds messages
    -TileMap now holds its own arraylist of npcs (will hold any map-specific data like items)

    -player is animated
    -camera is implemented, tilesize bumped to 64 to show it off

TODO

    TileMap.java
        -redesign to use a 2d array of tiles as main data structure
        -could hold a second array (or hashmap<Point,Tile>) for overlay tiles (bed, chair)
            so that draw() will iterate over tile array, then draw the overlays 

    Tile.java
        -will hold tile info such as isBlocking, hasSprite, etc.

NEXT MILESTONE

        -multiple possible player starting tiles
    -simpler TileMap data access
